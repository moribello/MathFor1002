probData{
    isFog = boolean (is the nozzle a fog nozzle? If not, it's a smooth bore)
    hoseSize = numeric value [1.5, 1.75, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]
    humanNames = str (describes hose size in human names)
    hoseLength = int (length of hose)
    tipSize = numeric value [.75, 1, 1.25] (only exists / used if "isFog" = 'false')
    humanTip = str from array "humanTipSizes"
    flowRate = numeric value (calculated from isFog, tipSize, and hoseSize)
    flCoef = numeric value from object "coefficients"
    isMS = boolean (is this a master stream; if flowRate > 350 isMS = true)
    isElev = boolean (is the nozzle above the pump)
    floors = numeric value of floors above the pump
    workingFloor = str from array "humanWorkingFloor". Note that this will be a human value for one floor above "floors" (i.e., floors = 5 will be "sixth" - five floors above the pump is the sixth floor)
    eLoss = numeric value based on number of stories above pump
